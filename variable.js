// let define variables
let age;
console.log(age); // return undeclare
// let age = 10; this is how we assign the value to a variable on declaration
//note we dont need to use let every time when we declare a variable

//example:-
let myage =  22;
console.log(myage);
//update:-
myage = 23;
console.log(myage);
// dont use this bad declaration
let x = 12;
let y = 11;
// good declaration
let name = "nagu";
console.log(name);

// declare a variable with _(underscore) ($) dollar at start prefix but we cant start with number
let game;
let _model;
let $car;
//but we can't use:-
//let 1num; -- it will not work

//js is case sensitive
let num = 10;
let Num = 20;
console.log(num); //10
console.log(Num); //20
// important to stick with a consistent naming convention superCar superBike



// let, const, function, or return, as they are reserved for the language itself we cant use it

//You should also avoid using special characters like exclamation points (!) or at (@) symbols, in your variable names. It is best to keep variable names readable by using letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs.
