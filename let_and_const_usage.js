//let is use for updating program tracking
let mark; // we can declare without value
marks = 10
marks = 20; // updated or modify
console.log(marks);

//const is used for fixed non mutable value
const score = 100; //const must be declare with value in it

//we can use var in place of let but it not recommend it has a wider scope
